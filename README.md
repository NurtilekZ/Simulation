# Simulation

Thesis Diploma Project

The goal of this project is to develop the application to learn and teach Physics using  computer simulation and 3D graphics. The uniqueness of this project among other simulation  Services is learning through completing tasks in specific physics topics using special tools and  formulas to understand why and how these laws and theorems are correct or not. Instead of plain  old memorizing information that goes to short-term memory, the 3D representation can give  students more engagement and fun to work on tasks and challenge themselves in physics with  help of active learning. The application is developed using Unity game engine and C#  programming language.
